# Biography
I am is a Phd. candiate in Agricultural & Consumer Economics. My research interests lie in the field of environmental economics with a concentration on conservation policy, environmental justice, and non-market valuation. I focus on understanding the human-environment nexus using modern econometric methods for causal inference and several tools in the non-market valuation toolbox. In my current research, I study the effects of policies to protect and restore the environment, and I explore sources of heterogeneity in individuals' preferences for environmental amenities.
